 Materials for MATH 321: Advanced Calculus (Westminster College's Intro to Real Analysis)

**Note**: these .pdf files were generated by [LyX](https://lyx.org), a WYSIWYG editor with inline LaTeX, which is required to open the .lyx files. If you don't want to edit the notes, just read them, I recommend viewing the pdf files in the [latest release](https://github.com/kaince/advanced-calculus-notes/releases/) only.
