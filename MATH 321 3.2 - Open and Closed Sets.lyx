\begin_layout Itemize
The Cantor set extends the horizons of our intuition about the nature of
 subsets of the real line.
\end_layout

Last time, we found that the Cantor set was both big (in the sense of cardinalit
y) and small (in the sense of length).
 It doesn't contain any intervals!

item Consider the set given by starting with $D_0=
\backslash
left[0,1
\backslash
right]$ and removing middle fourths at each stage (so that $D_1=
\backslash
left[0,
\backslash
frac{3}{8}

\backslash
cup
\backslash
left[
\backslash

 What is the length of $D$? What is the cardinality of $D$? Does $D$ contain
 any intervals? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
item Now consider the set $F$ given by varying the proportion of the intervals
 removed at each step in the following way.
 As usual, let $F_0=
\backslash
left[0,1
\backslash
right]$.
 Start by removing the middle fourth again, so that $F_1=
\backslash
left[0,
\backslash
frac{3}{8}
\backslash

\backslash
cup
\backslash
left[
\backslash
frac{5}{8},1
\backslash

 For the next step, only remove an interval of length $
\backslash
frac{1}{16}$ from each of the intervals of $F_1$.
 At step 3, we remove an interval of length $
\backslash
frac{1}{64}$ from each of the four intervals remaining.
 We continue this pattern to get the set $F$, called a Smith-Volterra-Cantor
 set or a fat Cantor set.
 What is the length of $F$? The cardinality? Does $F$ contain any intervals?

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
As before, we first consider the lengths of the removed intervals.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
At stage 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

, we remove one interval of length 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{4}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
At stage 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

, we begin with the intervals 
\begin_inset Formula $[0,\frac{3}{8}]$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $[\frac{5}{8},1]$
\end_inset

, each of length 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{3}{8}$
\end_inset

.
 We then remove the middle fourth of each of these two intervals, which
 has length 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{4}(\frac{3}{8})=\frac{3}{32}$
\end_inset

.
 The total length removed at stage 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 is thus 
\begin_inset Formula $2(\frac{1}{4})(\frac{3}{32})=\frac{3}{16}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
At stage 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

, we begin with four intervals each of length 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{3}{8}-\frac{3}{32}=\frac{12}{32}-\frac{3}{32}=\frac{9}{32}$
\end_inset

.
 We then remove the middle fourth of each interval, which has length 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{4}(\frac{9}{32})=\frac{9}{128}$
\end_inset

.
 The total length removed at stage 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

 is thus 
\begin_inset Formula $4(\frac{1}{4})(\frac{9}{32})=\frac{9}{32}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
At stage 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, the pattern continues: we have 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{n-1}$
\end_inset

 intervals and remove a total length of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{4}(\frac{3}{4})^{n-1}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The sum of the lengths of the removed intervals is thus
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{4}\Big(\frac{3}{4}\Big)^{n-1} & =\frac{1}{4}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\Big(\frac{3}{4}\Big)^{n-1}\\
 & =\frac{1}{4}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\Big(\frac{3}{4}\Big)^{n}\\
 & =\frac{1}{4}\Big(\frac{1}{1-3/4}\Big)\\
 & =\frac{1}{4}\Big(\frac{1}{1/4}\Big)=1.
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Thus, the length of the middle-fourths Cantor set is still 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
By a similar argument to the regular Cantor set, we can construct a 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 correspondence 
\begin_inset Formula $f:D\to S$

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $0$

 Every time we had an interval, we made sure to remove part of it.

At stage

\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{8}$

\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{4}(\frac{1}{2})^{n-1}$

\begin_layout Enumerate
The total length removed is thus 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{4}\Big(\frac{1}{2}\Big)^{n-1} & =\frac{1}{4}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\Big(\frac{1}{2}\Big)^{n-1}\\
 & =\frac{1}{4}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\Big(\frac{1}{2}\Big)^{n}\\

The length of the Smith-Volterra-Cantor set is thus 
\begin_inset Formula $1-\frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{2}$

\begin_layout Enumerate
Because the Smith-Volterra-Cantor set has nonzero length, it must have cardinali

Even though the S-V-C set has nonzero length, it contains no intervals!

 If you think the statement is false for that set $X$, give an example of

 Then think about what the sets that contain the limits of their Cauchy

\begin_layout Itemize
It turns out that every Cauchy sequence in

 Intuitively, this is because these sets

 to solve optimization problems, we need our constraint (interval) to be

\begin_layout Itemize
Topologists like myself are bigger fans of open sets :)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Open sets are more intuitively characterized than closed sets, so let's
 start by characterizing open sets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Open sets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The prototypical open set is the 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

-neighborhood you've already encountered:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition
Given 
\begin_inset Formula $a\in\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon>0$
\end_inset

, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset


\series bold
-neighborhood of 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset


\series default
 is the set
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
V_{\epsilon}(a)=\{x\in\mathbb{R}:|x-a|<\epsilon\}=(a-\epsilon,a+\epsilon).
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition
A set 
\begin_inset Formula $O\subseteq\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 is 
\series bold
open 
\series default
if for all points 
\begin_inset Formula $a\in O$
\end_inset

, there exists an 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

-neighborhood 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{\epsilon}(a)$
\end_inset

 that's also contained in 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
Consider the open interval
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
(c,d)=\{x\in\mathbb{R}:c<x<d\}.
\]

\end_inset

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in(c,d)$
\end_inset

 be arbitrary.
 [draw] If we take 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon=\min\{x-c,d-x\}$
\end_inset

 [the distance to the closest endpoints; draw], then it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{\epsilon}(x)=(x-\epsilon,x+\epsilon)$
\end_inset

 is contained in 
\begin_inset Formula $(c,d)$
\end_inset

.
 This is because 
\begin_inset Formula $x-\epsilon\geq x-(x-c)=c$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x+\epsilon\leq x+(d-x)=d$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Question
Why don't we define open sets to be the same as open intervals

\begin_layout Exercise
Does this argument work if the interval contains one of its endpoints? What
 if we replace 
\begin_inset Formula $(c,d)$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $(a,b)\cup(c,d)$
\end_inset

, the union of two open intervals?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The union of open intervals is also open.
 This observation leads to the next result:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
(i) The union of an arbitrary (potentially uncountable) collection of open
 sets is open.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
(ii) The intersection of a finite collection of open sets is open.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
(i) How do we label the elements of a potentially-uncountable set 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

? Well, no matter how many elements there are, we can put the elements of
 the set into one-to-one correspondence with 
\emph on
some 
\emph default
(perhaps uncountable) set, call it 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$
\end_inset

.
 This effectively 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

labels
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 each element of 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

 with a corresponding 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\in\Lambda$
\end_inset

, so we can call each element of 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $O_{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 for some 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 Then we can write 
\begin_inset Formula $\{O_{\lambda}:\lambda\in\Lambda\}$
\end_inset

 to represent our collection of open sets, no matter how many there are.
 This is standard notation; mathematicians often index uncountable sets
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\{U_{\lambda}\}_{\lambda\in\Lambda}$
\end_inset

, where the 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

's are the elements of our uncountable set and the 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

's are labelings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Now, let 
\begin_inset Formula $O=\bigcup_{\lambda\in\Lambda}O_{\lambda}$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $a\in O$
\end_inset

.
 We want to show that there exists an 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $(a-\epsilon,a+\epsilon)\subseteq O$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Since 
\begin_inset Formula $a\in O$
\end_inset

, we must have that 
\begin_inset Formula $a\in O_{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 for some 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\in\Lambda$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Because we assume 
\begin_inset Formula $O_{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 to be open, there exists a neighborhood 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{\epsilon}(a)\subseteq O_{\lambda}$
\end_inset

.
 But since 
\begin_inset Formula $O_{\lambda}\subseteq O$
\end_inset

, we must have 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{\epsilon}(a)\subseteq O$
\end_inset

 as well, completing the proof.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
(ii) Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\{O_{1},O_{2},\dots,O_{N}\}$
\end_inset

 be a finite collection of open sets.
 Now, if 
\begin_inset Formula $a\in\bigcap_{k=1}^{N}O_{k}$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 is an element of each of the open sets.
 By the definition of an open set, we know that, for each 
\begin_inset Formula $1\leq k\leq N$
\end_inset

, there exists 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{\epsilon_{k}}(a)\subseteq O_{k}$

Why doesn't the proof of (ii) generalize to an arbitrary intersection of

\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\inf$
\end_inset

 a counterexample to show that, in fact, it's possible for the arbitrary

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula $(\impliedby)$

 Assume 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim a_{n}=x$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n}\in A$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $a_{n}\neq x$
\end_inset

, and let 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{\epsilon}(x)$
\end_inset

 be an arbitrary 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

-neighborhood.
 The (topological) definition of convergence assures us that there is a
 term 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{N}$
\end_inset

 in the sequence satisfying 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{N}\in V_{\epsilon}(x)$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula $(\implies)$
\end_inset

 Assume 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is a limit point of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 In order to produce a sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $(a_{n})$
\end_inset

 converging to 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, we'll consider the 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

-neighborhoods obtained using 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon=1/n$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is a limit point of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, every neighborhood 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{1/n}(x)$
\end_inset

 intersects 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 in some point other than 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, for each 
\begin_inset Formula $n\in\mathbb{N}$
\end_inset

, we can choose a point
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
a_{n}\in V_{1/n}(x)\cap A
\]

\end_inset

with the stipulation that 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n}\neq x$
\end_inset

.
 Then it seems like 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim a_{n}=x$
\end_inset

.
 To justify this, let 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon>0$
\end_inset

 be arbitrary, and choose 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 by the Archimedean Property so that 
\begin_inset Formula $1/N<\epsilon$
\end_inset

 It follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $|a_{n}-x|<\epsilon$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $n\geq N$

\begin_inset Formula $V_{\epsilon}(0)\cap\{0\}=\{0\}$
\end_inset

 for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon>0$

\begin_inset Formula $V_{\epsilon}(0)$
\end_inset

 must intersect 
\begin_inset Formula $\{0\}$
\end_inset

 in some point other than 
\begin_inset Formula $0$

 to be a limit point.

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\{0\}$

 Hence, by definition, there must be some neighborhood 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{\epsilon}(x)$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 that does not intersect the set 
\begin_inset Formula $O^{c}$
\end_inset

.
 But this means 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{\epsilon}(x)\subseteq O$
\end_inset

, as desired.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 was arbitrary, 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

 is open.

\begin_layout Proof
The second statement follows quickly from the first using the observation
 that 
\begin_inset Formula $(E^{c})^{c}=E$
\end_inset

 for any set 
\begin_inset Formula $E\subseteq\mathbb{R}$

 These sets must have the property that countable unions and finite intersection

\begin_layout Question
Based on the fact that closed sets are the complements of open sets, give
 some examples of closed sets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
\begin_inset Formula $(-\infty,0]\cup[1,\infty)$

 is closed because it's the complement of 
\begin_inset Formula $(0,1)$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$

 is closed because it's the complement of the open set 
\begin_inset Formula $\emptyset$

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $\emptyset$
\end_inset

 is closed because it's the complement of the open set

\begin_layout Theorem
(i) The union of a finite collection of closed sets is closed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
(ii) The intersection of an arbitrary collection of closed sets is closed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Note that these are the

 properties of those satisfied by open sets.
 De Morgan's Laws state that for any collection of sets 
\begin_inset Formula $\{E_{\lambda}:\lambda\in\Lambda\}$
\end_inset

 it is true that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Big(\bigcup_{\lambda\in\Lambda}E_{\lambda}\Big)^{c}=\bigcap_{\lambda\in\Lambda}E_{\lambda}^{c}\text{ and }\Big(\bigcap_{\lambda\in\Lambda}E_{\lambda}\Big)^{c}=\bigcup_{\lambda\in\Lambda}E_{\lambda}^{c}.
